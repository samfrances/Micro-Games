# Starship Takeoff

You are a starship captain. You have crashed your ship on a strange
planet and must take off again quickly in the alien ship you have captured.
The ship's computer tells you the gravity on the planet. You must guess
the force required for a successful take off. If you guess too low,
the ship will not lift off the ground. If you guess too high, the ship's
fail-safe mechanism comes into operation to prevent it being burnt up.
If you are still on the planet after ten tries, the aliens will capture
you.
